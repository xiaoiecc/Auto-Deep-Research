## 🧐 Why to release Auto-Deep-Research?

After releasing AutoAgent (previously known as MetaChain) for a week, we've observed three compelling reasons to introduce Auto-Deep-Research:

1. **Community Interest** 
</br>We noticed significant community interest in our Deep Research alternative functionality. In response, we've streamlined the codebase by removing non-Deep-Research related components to create a more focused tool.

2. **Framework Extensibility**
</br>Auto-Deep-Research serves as the first ready-to-use product built on AutoAgent, demonstrating how quickly and easily you can create powerful Agent Apps using our framework.

3. **Community-Driven Improvements**
</br>We've incorporated valuable community feedback from the first week, introducing features like one-click launch and enhanced LLM compatibility to make the tool more accessible and versatile.

Auto-Deep-Research represents our commitment to both the community's needs and the demonstration of AutoAgent's potential as a foundation for building practical AI applications.

## ⚡ Quick Start

<span id='installation'/>

### Installation

#### Auto-Deep-Research Installation

```bash
conda create -n auto_deep_research python=3.10
conda activate auto_deep_research
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research.git
cd Auto-Deep-Research
pip install -e .
```

#### Docker Installation

We use Docker to containerize the agent-interactive environment. So please install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) first. You don't need to manually pull the pre-built image, because we have let Auto-Deep-Research **automatically pull the pre-built image based on your architecture of your machine**.

<span id='api-keys-setup'/>

### API Keys Setup

Create a environment variable file, just like `.env.template`, and set the API keys for the LLMs you want to use. Not every LLM API Key is required, use what you need.

<span id='start-auto-deep-research'/>

### Start Auto-Deep-Research

#### Command Options:

You can run `auto deep-research` to start Auto-Deep-Research. Some configuration of this command is shown below.

- `--container_name`: Name of the Docker container (default: 'deepresearch')
- `--port`: Port for the container (default: 12346)
- `COMPLETION_MODEL`: Specify the LLM model to use, you should follow the name of [Litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) to set the model name. (Default: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`)
- `DEBUG`: Enable debug mode for detailed logs (default: False)
- `API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the LLM provider (default: None)
- `FN_CALL`: Enable function calling (default: None). Most of time, you could ignore this option because we have already set the default value based on the model name.

#### Different LLM Providers

We will show you how easy it is to start Auto-Deep-Research with different LLM providers.

##### Anthropic

* set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
```

* run the following command to start Auto-Deep-Research.

```bash
auto deep-research # default model is claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

##### OpenAI

* set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

* run the following command to start Auto-Deep-Research.

```bash
COMPLETION_MODEL=gpt-4o auto deep-research
```

##### Mistral

* set the `MISTRAL_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

```bash
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
```

* run the following command to start Auto-Deep-Research.

```bash
COMPLETION_MODEL=mistral/mistral-large-2407 auto deep-research
```

##### Gemini - Google AI Studio

* set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

* run the following command to start Auto-Deep-Research.

```bash
COMPLETION_MODEL=gemini/gemini-2.0-flash auto deep-research
```

##### Huggingface

* set the `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

```bash
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key
```

* run the following command to start Auto-Deep-Research.

```bash
COMPLETION_MODEL=huggingface/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct auto deep-research
```

##### Groq

* set the `GROQ_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

* run the following command to start Auto-Deep-Research.

```bash
COMPLETION_MODEL=groq/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b auto deep-research
```

##### OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints (e.g., Grok)

* set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_for_openai_compatible_endpoints
```

* run the following command to start Auto-Deep-Research.

```bash
COMPLETION_MODEL=openai/grok-2-latest API_BASE_URL=https://api.x.ai/v1 auto deep-research
```

##### OpenRouter (e.g., DeepSeek-R1)

We recommend using OpenRouter as LLM provider of DeepSeek-R1 temporarily. Because official API of DeepSeek-R1 can not be used efficiently.

* set the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
```

* run the following command to start Auto-Deep-Research.

```bash
COMPLETION_MODEL=openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-r1 auto deep-research
```

##### DeepSeek

* set the `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

```bash
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
```

* run the following command to start Auto-Deep-Research.

```bash
COMPLETION_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-chat auto deep-research
```

### Tips

#### Import browser cookies to browser environment

You can import the browser cookies to the browser environment to let the agent better access some specific websites. For more details, please refer to the [cookies](./metachain/environment/cookie_json/README.md) folder.
